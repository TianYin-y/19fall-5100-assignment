final(lowercase) is a reserved keyword in java. We can’t use it as an identifier as it is reserved. 
We can use this keyword with variables, methods and also with classes. 
The final keyword in java has different meaning depending upon it is applied to variable, class or method.

Just as final is a reserved keyword, so in same way finally is also a reserved keyword in java i.e, we can’t use it as an identifier. 
The finally keyword is used in association with a try/catch block and guarantees that a section of code will be executed, even if an exception is thrown. 
The finally block will be executed after the try and catch blocks, but before control transfers back to its origin.
