Q9. Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words).
Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, 
for example, a car which is mixed of several components. 
Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it. 
The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.

Q10. What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction.
Abstraction is about hiding unwanted details while giving out most essential details, 
while Encapsulation means hiding the code and data into a single unit e.g. class 
or method to protect inner working of an object from outside world
